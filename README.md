# SpotifyData

This project includes:
1) analysis of my Spotify playlists - simple exploratory data analysis
2) classification model - the model is based on music from my personal playlists and on data from a Kaggle dataset and should predict which songs from my "Check" playlist I will like. My "check" playlist includes songs that I found somehow interesting but not good enough to add them to other playlists. I usually "check" them again and decide whether delete them or add to another playlist (yeah, I'm a music freak and I really take care of my playlists ;)) So, maybe a machine learning model can make this decision for me?
