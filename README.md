# SpotifyData

This project includes:
1) Data preparation (Python: pandas, numpy, json)
2) Data analysis of my Spotify playlists (Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
3) Classification model - the model will be based on the data from my personal playlists as well as on the data from a Kaggle dataset and should predict which songs from my "Check" playlist I will like. My "Check" playlist includes songs that I found interesting but I wasn't sure if I want to have them in my regular playlists. I usually listen to those songs again later and decide whether to delete them or to add them to another playlist. Maybe a machine learning model can make this decision for me? (Python: Scikit-learn)
